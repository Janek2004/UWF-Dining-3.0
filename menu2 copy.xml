Meal Plans for Students living in University Housing
All First-Time-In-College students living in University housing are required to participate in the mandatory meal plan program at a ten (10) Meal Plan level or higher per semester their first two (2) consecutive semesters on campus (summer residence not included). The default for the first semester is the 10 Meal Plan. However, the plan may be upgraded to the 15 or 19 Meal Plan. The second semester, the plan will default to the plan you had at the end of the first semester. The cost of the meal plan is not included in the rental rate for University housing. All First-Time-In-College students living in university housing will have meal plans available for use in time for Housing check-in.
Meal Plans and Block Plans are available to all students. Voluntary meal plans must be paid before the meal plan will be issued unless otherwise approved by Student Accounts. Fall Meal Plans will be available for purchase July 1.
Changes may be made to meal plans through the first two weeks after the start of classes or after the purchase of a meal plan, whichever is later. Prices are for one semester only. Meal Plans and unused Argo Bucks expire at the end of each semester. Payment for a meal plan is due at the same time as the student's Unviersity housing payment. There is no contract for meal plans. Meal plan purchases may be made in the UWF Cashier's Office, mailed to the Cashier's Office, or paid online via the student's ARGUS account.
